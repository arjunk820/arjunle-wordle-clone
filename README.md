# Arjunle 🟩🟨⬜

**Arjunle** is a fast-paced, 4-letter word guessing game inspired by Wordle — with a twist.  
Instead of the traditional five-letter challenge, Arjunle ramps up the pressure: **guess the secret 4-letter English word in just 5 tries**.

Built for quick play and minimalist fun, Arjunle is designed with simplicity in mind — no sign-ups, no clutter, just gameplay.
